# Social Network API

This Social Network API uses Mongoose to create connections in JavaScript and saves them to a MongoDB (NoSQL) database. Once the express server is started, the user can use [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to run the GET, CREATE, PUT, and DELETE routes in order view or edit users (and friends) and thoughts (and reactions).
